This project implements a Stock Price Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in R. The goal is to forecast future stock prices based on historical stock data.

🛠️ Technologies Used
R programming language
keras package (TensorFlow backend)
tensorflow package
tidyverse for data manipulation
scales for data scaling
lubridate for date-time handling

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction-lstm-r.git
cd stock-price-prediction-lstm-r
Install required R packages:

r
Copy
Edit
install.packages(c("keras", "tensorflow", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "scales"))
Set up Keras and TensorFlow in R:

r
Copy
Edit
library(keras)
install_keras()
Download stock data:

You can manually download historical stock data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance) and place the CSV file inside the data/ folder.

Ensure your CSV has columns like: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.

Run the script:

r
Copy
Edit
source("stock_price_lstm.R")
Check Results:

The script will generate predictions and visualize them against the actual stock prices.

Plots will be saved inside the plots/ folder.

🔥 Key Features
Data preprocessing: scaling, cleaning, and preparing sequences

LSTM model creation and training

Stock price prediction

Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices

Easy to customize for any stock symbol

📈 Sample Output
(Add a plot here once you run the project. Example: a line chart showing predicted vs actual prices.)

📋 Requirements
R version >= 4.0.0

Python installation (for Keras and TensorFlow backend, managed by R)

Good internet connection (for package installations)

✨ Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of layers, units, dropout rate)

Predicting multiple steps ahead

Incorporating technical indicators (like Moving Averages, RSI)

Building a web app for live predictions using Shiny
